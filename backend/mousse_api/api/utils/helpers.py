def epoch_to_months(epoch):
    """
    Converts an epoch representation to a list of months.

    The function maps season names (e.g., 'summer', 'winter') to their corresponding 
    months and includes any directly specified month values in the epoch input. 
    Duplicate months are removed, and the final result is a unique list of months.

    Args:
        epoch (list): A list containing season names or month numbers. 
            Each item in the list must have a `value` attribute.

    Returns:
        list[int]: A list of unique month numbers corresponding to the input epoch.
